# Single_Switch_Hotswap_PCB_Module

A simple single switch pcb for mechanical keyboard prototyping row and column matrices.
PCB features a hot swappable socket and uses a 1n4148 SMD diode.

13 Feb 2022 - did the initial BOM. Created kicad project. Need to start on mounting symbol and footprint

## To Do
- Initial BOM (done 13 Feb 2022)
- Symbol and footprint for each component
- Schematics
- Board outline
- Board routing
- Create a PCB with matrix of single switch for manufacturing.

## Initial BOM
- hotswap socket (need to create library)
- 1n4148 SMD diode
- 4 pin headers (2 for column, 2 for row)
- 4 mounting holes (M3?)
